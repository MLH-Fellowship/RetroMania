> Save the knight or else he dies

## 🐲 STORY

A long time ago, in a land far away, there was a kingdom that was cursed by an evil sorcerer. The kingdom was called `Retro`. Before the curse, Retro was one of the happiest places in the world. When the cursed happened, everything changed. People started turning into zombies, monsters.

Seeing how the Retro was slowly becoming a graveyard, the King decided to send the bravest of his knights to capture the evil sorcerer. During the knight's quest, he got tricked by the sorcerer and was led into a trap. The news of the knight's capture spread like the wildfire in the kingdom. Everyone became petrified thinking that there is no hope anymore.

At that grave time, a young lady who claimed that she was from the future stepped forward. She undertook the quest of destroying the evil sorcerer and saving the knight and along with him the entire kingdom.
